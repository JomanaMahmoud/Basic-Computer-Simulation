# Basic Computer Simulation
## Project Description

Implement a simulation of a basic computer memory system, arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), and a set of registers. These components will be interconnected through a common bus controlled by three select lines (S2, S1, S0).

1. **Memory (RAM)**
   - Size: 128 addresses (words).
   - Each word is 16 bits.
   - Users can read from and write to memory.
   - The Address Register (AR) output connects to the memory's address lines.
   - Memory's input and output lines are connected to the common bus.

2. **Registers**
   - Available registers: DR, TR, AR, AC (Accumulator Register), PC, IR.
   - Each register has a load enable flag to control data updates from the bus.
   - Registers do not have increment (INC) or clear (CLR) capabilities.

3. **ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit)**
   - Two inputs: A (from DR) and B (from AC).
   - Control lines (C2, C1, C0) determine the ALU operations:
     - `(001) Transfer input A`
     - `(010) Increment A`
     - `(011) Multiply A * B`
     - `(100) Subtract A - B`
     - `(101) Divide A / B`
     - `(110) Add A + B`
     - `(111) A XOR B`

4. **Bus Selection**
   - Control select lines determine which component is connected to the bus:
     - `(000) Memory`
     - `(001) AR`
     - `(010) PC`
     - `(011) AC`
     - `(100) DR`
     - `(101) TR`
     - `(111) IR`

Then we enhance the basic computer by adding a control unit, implementing the PC register as a counter and implementing a specific program.

5. **Control Unit**
   - Add decoders, sequence counters, and logic gates to implement the control unit.
   - Ensure all unused control signals are set to zero for stability.
   - Redesign timing diagrams for instructions as registers do not have clear or increment functionalities (or design registers to include these features).

6. **Program Assembly**
   - Implement the following program:
     ```c
     int A, B, C, i; // variables
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
         C += A / B;
         A += A * B;
     }
     ```
   - Example expected outputs after 3 iterations: A = 432, B = 2, C = 104.

7. **Instruction Set**
   - Implement the following instructions: LDA, MUL, ADD, STA, DIV, ISZ, BUN.
   - Use BSA opcode for MUL and AND opcode for DIV.
   - Ignore HLT and interrupt instructions; use normal instruction cycle.

## How to Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yehiarasheed/Basic-Computer-Simulation.git
   cd Basic-Computer-Simulation
   ```
   This command downloads a copy of the repository to your local machine and navigates into the project directory.

2. **Install PSpice:**
   Download and install PSpice from the [official PSpice website](https://www.pspice.com/). PSpice is essential for running and modifying the simulation files.

3. **Open the Project in PSpice:**
   - Launch PSpice.
   - Navigate to the project files by selecting `File â†’ Open` and choosing the appropriate `.circ` file from the cloned repository.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependency:

- **PSpice**: The application required to run and simulate the basic computer architecture.

Make sure PSpice is installed and correctly configured on your machine to execute the simulation files in this project.
